## Prerequisites
  * Install the Google Ceres solver  http://ceres-solver.org/installation.html
  * ROS [Melodic](http://wiki.ros.org/melodic) or later, tested with ubuntu 16.04, 18.04 and 20.04
  * The master branch contains the code used in the T-RO publication.

## How to build with catkin

```
$ mkdir -p ~/catkin_ws/src/
$ cd ~/catkin_ws/src/
$ git clone https://github.com/dan11003/CFEAR_Radarodometry_code_public.git
$ cd ~/catkin_ws
$ catkin_make -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release 
$ source ~/catkin_ws/devel/setup.bash
```
## Downloading data (Oxford Radar RobotCar)
Currently, only rosbags that contain sensor_msgs/Image are supported.
We prepared a rosbag from the Oxford Radar Robotcar dataset on our [google drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/12YNIvHQqSO5Et3UIzKD1z3XQACpoGZ1L?usp=sharing).
Download the Oxford bag file from (processed rosbag)/2019-01-10-12-32-52-radar-oxford-10k.bag to the folder created below:
```
$ mkdir -p /home/${USER}/Documents/oxford-eval-sequences/2019-01-10-12-32-52-radar-oxford-10k/
$ cd /home/${USER}/Documents/oxford-eval-sequences/2019-01-10-12-32-52-radar-oxford-10k/
$ mv ~/Downloads/2019-01-10-12-32-52-radar-oxford-10k.bag .
```

## Running
The odometry can be launched in two modes.
* Offline: (used in this guide) runs at the maximum possible rate.
* Online (not tested): Standard rostopic interface. radar_driver_node and odometry_keyframes. The radar_driver_node subscribes to "/Navtech/Polar" 

```
roscd cfear_radarodometry/launch
./oxford_demo # (Note: oxford trajectory is mirrored)
```

## Optional -  Evaluate odometry quality

```
cd ~/catkin_ws/src/
git clone https://github.com/dan11003/radar_kitti_benchmark 
cd radar_kitti_benchmark/python
./oxford_demo_eval.sh # Note that every run is evaluated
```

This will compute odometry error metrics, draw graphs and figures, and save these to the folder:
```
/home/${USER}/Documents/oxford-eval-sequences/2019-01-10-12-32-52-radar-oxford-10k/eval/<yyyy-mm-dd_HH:mm>,`
```
where the folder name <yyyy-mm-dd_HH:mm>  is set automatically according to time.

Some of the evaluation output is:
 * The raw trajectory (/est/01.txt)
 * Trajectory visualized (/est/plot_path/sequence_01_orig.pdf)  -  similar to Fig.15a in the article
 * Error metrics (/est/result.txt). -  Tab.III (row "CFEAR-3", column "10-12-32") in the article.
 * Parameters  (pars.txt)  - Tab.I (column "CFEAR-3")  in the article
 
 
NOTE: Results are slightly better compared to the article.

## Boreas dataset
Download from our [google drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1_5T4BEUUoVQ_XnlSYojDUCCkI7bcqwur)
Then create the followin folder;
```
$ mkdir -p /home/${USER}/Documents/boreas/boreas-2020-12-01-13-26/
$ cd /home/${USER}/Documents/boreas/boreas-2020-12-01-13-26/
$ mv ~/Downloads/boreas-2020-12-01-13-26.bag .
```

Then, proceed running CFEAR:
```
roscd cfear_radarodometry/launch
./boreas_demo
```

The result file is stored in directory 
```
/home/${USER}/Documents/boreas/boreas-2020-01-13-26/eval/<yyyy-mm-dd_HH:mm>/est/boreas
```
This result file can be used in the official [Boreas odometry benchmark](https://github.com/utiasASRL/pyboreas/blob/master/pyboreas/eval/odometry.md)

## Troubleshooting

If the fixes below does not help. Ask questions [here](https://github.com/dan11003/CFEAR_Radarodometry/issues).

### Malformed bagfile
```console
# Problem
user@computer:~$ terminate called after throwing an instance of 'rosbag::BagFormatException' what():  Required 'op' field missing
# Solution
rosbag reindex 2019-01-10-12-32-52-radar-oxford-10k.bag
```
### Compilation issue due to incompatible versions of LZ4 in ROS Melodic
During compilation, this error can occur on some installations of Ubuntu 18.04 with ROS Melodic:
```console
/usr/include/flann/ext/lz4.h:196:57: error: conflicting declaration ‘typedef struct LZ4_stream_t LZ4_stream_t’
 typedef struct { long long table[LZ4_STREAMSIZE_U64]; } LZ4_stream_t;
...
/usr/include/lz4.h:196:57: note: previous declaration as ‘typedef struct LZ4_stream_t LZ4_stream_t’
 typedef struct { long long table[LZ4_STREAMSIZE_U64]; } LZ4_stream_t;
```
and
```console
/usr/include/flann/ext/lz4.h:249:72: error: conflicting declaration ‘typedef struct LZ4_streamDecode_t LZ4_streamDecode_t’
 typedef struct { unsigned long long table[LZ4_STREAMDECODESIZE_U64]; } LZ4_streamDecode_t;
...
/usr/include/lz4.h:249:72: note: previous declaration as ‘typedef struct LZ4_streamDecode_t LZ4_streamDecode_t’
 typedef struct { unsigned long long table[LZ4_STREAMDECODESIZE_U64]; } LZ4_streamDecode_t;
```
This error is caused by two conflicting versions of LZ4, one used for ROS serialization and the other one by flann kdtree in PCL. As this [GitHub issue](https://github.com/ethz-asl/lidar_align/issues/16) suggests, there are a few ways to fix it, yet none of them can be really considered clean. We suggest using simlinks to point to a single version of the conficting header files, since this modification can be easily reverted:
```console
sudo mv /usr/include/flann/ext/lz4.h /usr/include/flann/ext/lz4.h.bak
sudo mv /usr/include/flann/ext/lz4hc.h /usr/include/flann/ext/lz4.h.bak


sudo ln -s /usr/include/lz4.h /usr/include/flann/ext/lz4.h
sudo ln -s /usr/include/lz4hc.h /usr/include/flann/ext/lz4hc.h
```
## Future

* Prepare demo for MulRan, VolvoCE, Kvarntorp and Orkla.
* Integrate reading of the raw data format adopted in the [Oxford dataset](https://github.com/ori-mrg/robotcar-dataset-sdk).

## Developing

Data from the MulRan dataset can be processed using the [file_player_tool](https://github.com/irapkaist/file_player_mulran).
Don't forget to specify the sensor resolution and the dataset parameter if you use something other than Oxford data.

## CFEAR use cases

### April 2023 - TBV Radar SLAM 
In the article TBV Radar SLAM by Adolfsson et al. CFEAR was integrated with robust loop closure into a fully-fledged system for large-scale, real-time, radar-only SLAM.
The method generalizes across diverse environments without the need for returning parameters. The [code is released here](https://github.com/dan11003/tbv_slam_public).


### October 2023 - RadaRays
[RadaRays](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2310.03505.pdf) is a method for simulating radar data, released as a gazebo plugin. Mock et al. were able to simulate radar scans by raytracing within a lidar map, and accurately estimate radar odometry in the MulRan dataset. The estimated trajectories closely resemble the odometry estimated from real radar data. The [code](https://github.com/uos/radarays_ros) and a [gazebo radar plugin](https://github.com/uos/radarays_gazebo_plugins) for the project has been released.
